Digital Clock by Ngoc Thang

HELLO
Welcome to mys Digital Clock Project!

Welcome to colorful digital clock, it just simply shows you the current time with glowing colorful effect. You can change between 12-hour and 24-hour clock. 


I made this project as order to practice coding.
In this project I use HTML, CSS and Javascript.
